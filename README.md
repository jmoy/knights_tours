Enumerate all closed knight's tours on chessboards of
arbitrary size.

Each executable expects to be called with two arguments
`m` and `n` and enumerate all knight's tours on an `m×n`
chessboard.

The C++ and Haskell versions are multithreaded.

The 3×12 board is a small example which runs in reasonable
time.
